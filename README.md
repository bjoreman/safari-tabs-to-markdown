safari-tabs-to-markdown
=======================

Script which turns the open tabs in the current Safari window into a Markdown list of URL:s in the clipboard. Suitable for saving as a service.

The original version was in Applescript. It has now been ported to Javascript (picking up a new feature in the process), but the old version remains available for reference and backward compatibility (scripting in Javascript is a new feature in 10.10).
